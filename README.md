# Video Downloader Application

## Computer Application to Download Youtube Videos in MP3 & MP4 formats

### Description

Utilizes basic tkinter functions to create a graphical user interface for the user to either submit links for downloading,
or providing a .txt file with links to parse through and populate the UI with. The user then decides a format to download
the video(s) in.

### Purpose

Developed to avoid the use of downloading videos from unfamiliar websites.

### Requirements

Must have the latest Python version installed.

Using pip, install the required python packages to the computer or use a virtual environment. Install packages by running `pip install yt_dlp`, or download [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and run `pip install -r pathname\requirements.txt`.

### Example

Run the program, and either download the [example.txt](example.txt) and open it with the program or try pasting a youtube link in the search bar.
